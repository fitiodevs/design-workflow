# Theme manager — human-readable guide

A friendly walkthrough of the design pipeline. Read this if you're new to the workflow and want the "why before how".

## Workflow patterns

### "I'm starting a new app"

```
/theme-create                    # Composer: palette from scratch (or --inspired-by <slug>)
/frontend-design                 # Designer: tweaks-ready HTML mockup
/tweaks <path>                   # Tweaker: wrap with knobs, ride 5 sliders, pick a state
/theme-critique --mode 5dim <path>  # Júri 5dim: radar-chart review of the chosen mockup
/theme-port --from-html <path>   # Architect: HTML → Flutter using tokens
/theme-audit                     # Auditor: measures coverage
```

The `/tweaks` step is new in v1.4 — it lets you explore variants without re-prompting Clara. Skip it for one-off mockups; use it when you can't articulate the tweak ahead of time. Output is a sibling `<input>.tweaks.html`; original input stays untouched. State persists to localStorage per-file.

### "I have a Figma frame and need it implemented"

```
/theme-port <figma-link>
/theme-critique
# if critique flags issues → bolder/quieter/distill as needed
```

### "Something looks off but I can't say what"

```
/theme-critique
```

It returns scored Nielsen heuristics + AI-slop verdict + persona walkthrough + cognitive load count + P0–P3 issue list with delegation suggestions. Read the verdict, follow the suggested next skill.

### "Low contrast in dark mode"

```
/theme-audit         # confirms which combinations fail WCAG
/theme-extend        # Surgeon: fixes the failing token
```

### "Mockup looks great but Flutter version doesn't match"

```
# 1. Generate the mockup
/frontend-design

# 2. Port the HTML directly (no Figma round-trip needed)
/theme-port --from-html /tmp/<feature>_mockup.html
```

`frontend-design` (Designer / Clara) generates HTML mockups; `theme-port` (Architect / Arquiteto) converts them — or any other HTML source, or a Figma frame — into widgets using your tokens. The Designer + Architect handoff is intentional: Designer obsesses over typography rhythm, alignment, microcopy; Architect translates structure to code. Same skill handles HTML from Stitch, Penpot, Figma's HTML export, or hand-written.

## How personas refuse work

Each persona has a clear "NOT for" list. If you ask the wrong one, they delegate:

- Auditor refuses palette decisions → routes to Composer
- Composer refuses single-token tweaks → routes to Surgeon
- Critic refuses to write code → routes to Architect / Surgeon / etc.
- Choreographer refuses motion-for-motion → recommends just shipping the static screen
- Designer refuses Flutter code → routes to Architect
- Distiller refuses to add features → only removes

This isn't bureaucracy. It's a way to keep each skill *narrow enough* to actually be opinionated.

## When to use which "calmer/bolder/distill"

After a critique:

- **Screen feels timid / "AI safe" / no impact** → `theme-bolder` (Amplifier / Brasa)
- **Screen feels aggressive / shouty / oversaturated** → `theme-quieter` (Refiner / Calma)
- **Screen feels overloaded / >4 decisions / I don't know where to look** → `theme-distill` (Distiller / Lâmina)

If 2 of these apply, do them in this order: `distill` → `bolder` (or `quieter`). Reducing decisions first reveals what actually needs amplification or calming.

## Anti-AI-slop primer

The scoring is calibrated against [Anthropic's design tone guide](https://www.anthropic.com/) plus 7 archetypal slop patterns (see [methodology.md](methodology.md)). Three positive signals counter slop:

1. **Committed color** — no pastel-everything; pick a hero color and ride it.
2. **Earned motion** — every animation teaches something; otherwise remove.
3. **Type as image** — display-size headlines that compete with hero illustrations, not whisper labels.

A screen with all three signals + ≤ 4 decisions + WCAG passing rarely fails critique.
